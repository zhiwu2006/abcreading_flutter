My leg, he cries. Lerk takes Bonk to the doctor. Bonk has a broken leg, says the doctor. He will need your help.\nAt home, Lerk gives Bonk a bell. You can ring it when you need something. Bonk rings the bell right away. I need a story, says Bonk. Lerk reads him a story. Bonk rings the bell again. I need you to play checkers with me, says Bonk. Lerk plays many games of checkers with Bonk. Bonk rings the bell again. I need you to bake me a cherry pie, says Bonk. Lerk bakes a cherry pie for Bonk. This is nice, says Bonk. I ring the bell and you do what I want, says Bonk. Lerk frowns. You are being bossy, says Lerk. I am? asks Bonk. You are, says Lerk. Bonk rings the bell again. I need to say I'm sorry, says Bonk. Apology accepted, says Lerk. I also need some ice cream, says Bonk. Lerk brings him a banana split.\nSoon Bonk's leg heals. Bonk is as good as new, says the doctor. No more cast, says Bonk. I know something better than no more cast, says Lerk. What could be better than that? says Bonk. No more bell, says Lerk.",

That is as tall as 29 giraffes. It is built of stone.\nWork on the monument started in 1848. Work stopped and started many times. At times, there was not enough money. Work was also stopped by a war in the United States. The monument first opened in 1885.\nWhat's inside? People can go inside the monument. It has a statue of George Washington. It also has a museum. People can see special stones on the inside walls. Some stones were gifts from U.S. states. Other stones were gifts from people who wanted the monument to be built. People can go to the top of the monument. They can look out and see Washington, D.C.\nWhat's outside? Around the monument are 50 U.S. flags. The 50 flags stand for the 50 states. A big stone at the corner of the monument has many things inside it. The things honor George Washington and the United States.\nOh no! Cracks! An earthquake damaged the monument in 2011. Then a storm damaged it more. It took almost three years to repair the monument. Many people visit the Washington monument each year. If you visit it, what would you want to see?",

Jesse asked. He pulled a penny out of his pocket. No park here, he said. A pocket park is a small park, mom explained. April and Jesse thought a pocket park was a great idea.\nFirst our neighbors need to sign a paper, mom said. It says they want the park too. We'll take that with us when we go to City Hall, April said. April, Jesse, and their mom talked to the neighbors. Everyone signed the paper. Then mom took April and Jesse to City Hall. They showed a woman the paper. Mom had to fill out some other papers. Now we have to wait for the permit, mom said. It says we can build the park. They waited, and a few weeks later it came.\nLet's build a pocket park, April and Jesse said. Let's ask the neighborhood to help, mom replied. April, Jesse, and their mom talked to their neighbors again. Everyone wanted to help. The next weekend, the whole neighborhood met at the lot. They picked up trash and pulled weeds. They planted grass and flowers. Mr. Martin donated a nice bench. Mrs. Lee donated a fountain. April and Jesse painted a picture on the wall. Everyone was very tired when it was done. They had a little party in the pocket park. The neighborhood was happier because of the new park. Even Tiny made new friends.",

Why don't you ask the goats? said one sheep. They have been acting nervous, the sheep added. Millie asked the goats if they knew anything. An old goat said, Yesterday, I looked over the wall. I saw a wolf covered in sheep's wool. He added he was leading Dolly into the forest. Millie thought, where would a wolf get wool? Then she looked in the barn where the sheep got their haircuts. That gave her an idea.\nMillie told the sheep her plan. She covered herself with wool. So she looked like a sheep too. Then she moved to the edge of the field and pretended to graze. Soon the wolf covered in sheep's wool came near the field. Want to know where some tasty grass is? the wolf asked Millie. Follow me, he added. Millie followed him into the forest. The rest of the sheep quietly followed behind. The wolf led Millie to his den. Dolly was there. She was scared, but alive. Dolly! Millie barked loudly. The sheep ran into the wolf's den. They pinned the wolf against the den wall. His wool fell to the ground. Now the sheep saw what he really was. A wolf in sheep's clothing. The wolf backed down. There were many more of them than him. He ran from the den with his tail between his legs. Millie and the sheep all went home. Dolly never followed a strange sheep again.",

It makes me laugh and starts my day on a happy note. For breakfast, dad makes Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes. After school, dad and I kick the ball until dinner. For dessert, I always have a huge cookie with milk. I have my own special cup from Disneyland, but a few months ago, my parents told me some bad news. They said that I'm going to have a little sister.\nI know I'm not going to like it. I have never had to share my parents with anybody. My friend, Jeff, got a baby sister last year. His parents never have time to play with him, and they are always busy changing the baby's stinky diapers. Yuck. Mom and dad said that I will have to share my bedroom with the baby. She better not use my Disneyland cup. No way. I told mom that I don't want a baby sister, but that didn't seem to matter.\nToday, mom and dad are coming home with my new sister. I'm just going to tell them to take her back. I don't want to share my mom and dad or my room. Well, here they are. Dad is carrying some pink blankets. Is the baby inside there? Is she that small? Grandma goes outside. She hugs mom and then looks inside the pink blankets. I hear grandma say the baby is beautiful. I'm not going out there. I'm going to sit right here. Now mom is hugging me. Dad puts the baby in my lap, and then the most amazing thing happens. She reaches out and grabs my finger. She won't let go. I think she knows that I'm her big brother. She likes me already. Hey, maybe having a sister won't be so bad. I think mom and dad have enough love for both of us.",

Swimming lessons? asks Bonk. Yes, says Joop. They start today. Joop, Lerk, and Snag get ready. They put on their swimsuits and swim trunks. They bring their towels and goggles. Are you ready, Bonk? asks Snag. No, my swim trunks are too small, says Bonk. My towel is too big. My goggles are too big. I can't go to swimming lessons, says Bonk. But it won't be the same without you, says Snag. Snag trades swim trunks with Bonk. Lerk trades goggles with Bonk. Joop trades towels with Bonk. Now you can go with us, says Joop.\nAt the pool, monsters dive and splash. Lerk, Joop, and Snag meet their teacher. It is time to get in the water, says the teacher. The monsters jump in. But Bonk sits at the side of the pool. This water is too cold, says Bonk. It is too wet, says Bonk. I will just watch today. The monsters dive under the water. They blow bubbles. They kick their feet. The monsters have fun. But Bonk does not.\nAfter swimming lessons, Joop sits by Bonk. Are you afraid of the water, Bonk? she asks. Bonk crosses his arms and stomps his feet. I am a good swimmer, he says. Joop is quiet. Okay, I am not a good swimmer, says Bonk. I know how to swim a little bit, says Bonk. Joop is still quiet. Bonk hangs his head. I don't know how to swim at all, says Bonk. Joop pats Bonk's back. She rubs his head. Then we can all learn together, she says.\nThe next day, Bonk is the first monster ready. He has a life jacket. He has water wings. He has a dinosaur float. I went swimming last night, he says. The pool was closed, says Joop. Where did you swim? In my bathtub, says Bonk.",

        "content": "Bridges go over rivers and lakes. They go over bays and swamps. They go over highways and railroads. Some even float. Bridges are long and short. They can be high above the water. They can be near the water. They can carry cars, trucks, trains, and buses. Some carry people. Some carry water or oil.\nThe first bridges were made out of wood, rope, or stone. Today, most bridges are made of steel and concrete. The first bridges were simple. Some were just logs placed across a stream. Some were ropes stretched across a river. Later, stones were used to build stronger and longer bridges. In time, people were building bridges like the ones we see today. These are made of concrete and steel. They go across longer distances. There are names for different types of bridges. This table shows some of the types.\nBuilding bridges is a big job. It can take many years. It can cost millions of dollars. It can take many workers to build a bridge. Let's look at a bridge being built over a river. First, workers must build supports under the water. They hammer large steel tubes into the river bottom. The tubes, called piles, are filled with concrete. Next, workers put supports across the piles. The supports are built underwater using a special dam. A dam holds the water back. The workers can work where it is dry. Next, workers build piers. They are like the legs on a table. They will hold up the bridge. Then caps are put on the tops of the piers. Concrete pieces, called girders, are put between two piers. The girders hold up the roadway, and steel bars are placed between the girders. The steel bars make the concrete stronger. Concrete is poured over the steel bars. The concrete gets hard. Finally, the new bridge is ready for traffic.",

The most famous story is about a cherry tree. One day, George's father gave him a little hatchet. George wanted to try it out. The trees in the woods looked too big. But there was a pretty cherry tree in the garden. George swung his hatchet. He chopped the tree down, crash. Then he went off to play. George's father was very angry when he saw the tree. Who cut down my beautiful tree? he said. If George didn't say anything, no one would know. But George said, I did, and I cannot tell a lie.\nAnother story is about a horse. One morning, George went to the stable. He asked the stable man to give him the best horse. The stable man was afraid, but he gave George the horse. George took the horse out. He joined a big fox hunt. But the horse hurt its foot. George's mother saw the limping horse. She got very angry at the stable man. She was going to punish him harshly. But George said, I made him do it, mother.\nHere is another horse story. George's mother had a wild horse. No one knew how to ride it. George and his friends decided to try. George hopped on the horse. The horse bucked and tumbled. George hung on tight. But the horse had a bad heart. The horse fell over and couldn't get up. George and his friends were very upset. They didn't want to hurt the horse. George's mother came home. She asked about the horse. I'm so sorry. I hurt the horse, George said. George's mother was mad. But she was also proud of George. It takes courage to admit that you have done something wrong. George Washington was very honest. Honesty helped him become America's first president.",

Matteo and his mother were thrilled. The man had twins named Primo and Guapo. Matteo asked the twins to play baseball. Not with you, Primo said. Matteo got to do all the chores. The twins got to play. Just like Cinderella, said Primo. Guapo said, Let's call him Cinderella.\nOne day, the coach of the National Little League team came to town. He was holding tryouts. Matteo wanted to go. You can't go, Primo laughed. You don't have a uniform, said Guapo. Their father agreed. Matteo watched the other boys play. Then someone called his name. It was the lady from the taco cart. She said, I'm your fairy godmother. Why don't you play? she asked. I don't have a uniform, he said. She waved her magic spatula. Matteo looked down at his new uniform, smiling. Now no one will know it is you, the fairy godmother said. But you must leave the minute the tryouts are over, she added.\nOn the day of the tryouts, Matteo was the pitcher and got every boy out. Later that day, there were more tryouts. Matteo got every boy out again. When it was over, the team crowded around him. Matteo ran home, but he lost one shoe. He looked down. His new uniform was gone. The coach looked all over for the star pitcher. Every boy in town tried on the shoe. At Matteo's house, the twins tried on the shoe, but it didn't fit. Then Matteo tried, the shoe fit. Matteo will be our star pitcher, said the coach. And the twins will be our towel boys, he added.",

        "content": "How do we know dinosaurs lived on Earth? We know because we have found fossils in rocks all over the world. Scientists have found fossils of dinosaur bones, footprints, teeth, nests, and eggs. These scientists are carefully digging dinosaur fossils. They will dig up the bones of the dinosaur fossils out of the ground. They will wrap up the fossils to keep them safe. Then they will take them to a museum. At the museum, scientists will study the fossils. They will put the fossils together to make a skeleton. Some pieces of the skeleton might be missing. Scientists use what they know about other animals to make pieces fit.\nLearning from fossils. Scientists study other animals to learn about dinosaurs. Dinosaur bones may be bigger, but many are shaped the same. Scientists compare dinosaur bone fossils to other animals. They learn that some dinosaurs walked and some flew. Scientists study fossil footprints to see how fast dinosaurs moved. Some dinosaurs moved very slowly. Some moved faster than humans. Scientists study fossil teeth to learn what dinosaurs ate. Some teeth are sharp like the teeth of meat eaters. Other teeth are flat like the teeth of plant eaters. Scientists learn about dinosaur babies from fossil nests and eggs. Some dinosaurs may have sat on their eggs like many birds do. Scientists also find fossils of plants, fish, insects, and other animals. These fossils help them learn what Earth was like when dinosaurs lived here.\nHow long ago? Scientists study rocks where fossils are found. Older fossils are deeper in the ground than newer fossils. No one knows for sure why the dinosaurs disappeared millions of years ago.",

These traits include size, looks, and weapons. Let's look at some of the extreme traits insects have that help them.\nExtreme size. This beetle can grow as long as a pin. It can weigh as much as a banana. Extreme size and a hard cover protect it from its enemies. This insect can grow longer than a new pencil. Its size frightens smaller insects away. Animals don't eat it because they think it is just a big stick.\nExtreme lookalikes. Many insects look like other things. Their looks help them hide from animals that want to eat them. Some insects look like parts of plants. They can look like leaves, flowers, stems, or even thorns. There are insects with large fake eyes to scare hungry animals away. When scared, this caterpillar can make itself look like a snake.\nExtreme weapons. Some insects have extreme weapons to help them survive. Some of these insects use their weapons to get food. Others use their weapons to keep from becoming food. This insect digs a pit in the sand. It traps ants in the pit. Then it grabs an ant in its large sharp jaws. Yummy! This bug jumps on other insects. It stabs them with its sharp beak. It shoots out poison that turns their insides to goo. Then the bug sucks out the goo. Slurp! Watch out! This beetle sprays out boiling hot poison when touched. It stops animals from trying to eat it.\nConclusion. Insects have many ways to protect themselves.

        "content": "How fast can you run? How fast can you swim? Humans are slow compared to some animals.\nWhich animals are the fastest running? The fastest runner is the cheetah. It can go as fast as a car on a highway. Cheetahs can only run that speed for a short time, though. They sprint to catch prey. Cheetahs eat gazelles which are not quite as fast as cheetahs. Gazelles can run fast for a longer time, though. Small animals are slower than big animals, but some go fast for their size. The tiger beetle runs 170 times the length of its body in one second. If humans could do that, they could race jet planes.\nSwimming. Turtles are slow on land, yet the world's fastest reptile is a turtle. It can swim four times as fast as a human. The fastest animal in the sea is the sailfish. In a race, it can easily beat most motorboats. Its cousin, the swordfish, is almost as fast.\nFlying. Flying is the fastest way to get around. Some of the fastest animals are birds, bats, and insects. Falconflies are the fastest insects. They catch and eat other flying insects. They can even fly backwards. The fastest animal on earth is the peregrine falcon. It hunts other birds by diving on them from above. During a dive, it tucks in its wings and sails straight down, so fast.\nCheetahs run as fast as a car. Sailfish swim faster than a motorboat. Falcons dive as fast as an airplane. Animals can reach amazing speeds.",
