    "content": "Sarah and her family went to the beach on a sunny Saturday morning. The weather was perfect for swimming and playing in the sand. Sarah built a beautiful sandcastle while her brother Tom collected seashells along the shore. Their parents relaxed under a colorful umbrella, reading books and enjoying the peaceful sound of the waves. In the afternoon, they had a picnic lunch with sandwiches and fresh fruit. As the sun began to set, they packed up their things and headed home, tired but happy from their wonderful day at the beach.",
